Carefully follow these rules:
- Only implement the requested changes
- Don't change any existing behavior unless explicitly asked to do so
- When any code becomes even slightly complex, ask user if he'd like to refactor the code
- Never use any or unknown types unless user explicitly agrees to do so
- Use arrow functions whenever suitable over "function foo() {}"
